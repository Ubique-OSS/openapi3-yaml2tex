# Openapi3 yaml2tex
## Introduction

This converter was written to provide easy pdf documents for api documentations generated by our springbot-swagger3 generator. It won't work well with YAMLs provided from other places, but feel free to make a pull request to fix that :)

## Install
```bash
cargo install rusty-swagger
```

## Usage

In order to use it, you need the mustache templates as found in the repo.
